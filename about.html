<p>
  I'm a <em>software engineer </em> and <em>security researcher</em>.
  I'm passionate about FOSS, and I love building tools and software that are easy (and ideally fun) to use while solving interesting problems (or just problems in general). Apart from programming, I love to explore art, math, music, and a lot more than I can fit here.
  If you are into the same stuff, or have cool ideas for projects you want to share, feel free to reach out !
