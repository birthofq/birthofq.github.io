<p>
  I'm passionate about building tools and software that are easy (and ideally fun) to use while solving interesting problems (or just problems in general). Apart from programming, I love to explore art, math, music, politics, and a lot more than I can fit here.
  If you have interesting ideas for projects you want to share, or collaborate on, feel free to reach out !
