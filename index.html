        <p>I love building 🧪 things, breaking stuff apart to see how it works, and turning curiosity into projects.</p>
        <p>📚 I read a lot and occasionally write ✍🏾 about whatever I’m exploring 🔎—tech, security, reverse engineering, or anything that catches my interest.</p>  
        <p>💡 Always tinkering, always learning.</p>
