        <p>I spend most of my time exploring problems in various subjects I find interesting and <a href="/projects.html">creating</a> tools, software, and systems that solve them in simple, thoughtful ways. I also enjoy reading a lot, and I occasionally <a href="/blog.html">write</a> about whatever Iâ€™m working on or thinking about.</p>

        <p>
                Understanding social network design and how intentional design of online spaces can foster positive, adaptive behaviours that are both healthy, and useful in changing the way we organize as network participants offline.
