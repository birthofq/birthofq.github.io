        <p>I love <a href="/projects.html">building</a> 🧪 things, <a href="/projects.html">breaking</a> stuff apart to see how it works, and turning curiosity into projects.</p>
        <p>📚 I <a href="/library.html">read</a> a lot and occasionally <a href="/blog.html">write</a> ✍🏾 about whatever I’m exploring 🔎 or anything that catches my interest.</p>
