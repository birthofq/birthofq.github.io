        <p>I spend most of my time exploring a variety of challenges across domains I'm interested in, and I enjoy figuring out how to <a href="/projects.html">build</a> tools, software, or systems that address them in simple and interesting ways. I also enjoy reading a lot, and I occasionally <a href="/blog.html">write</a> about whatever Iâ€™m working on or thinking about.</p>

        <p>
                Understanding social network design and how intentional design of online spaces can foster positive, adaptive behaviours that are both healthy, and useful in changing the way we organize as network participants offline.
